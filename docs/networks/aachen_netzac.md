# Description

Netz.ac is currently active in the KaWo1, KaWo3, and Kullenhof dormitories. In addition to Wi-Fi and LAN access to the RWTH network, Netz.ac also offers services for the respective house associations. This includes managing members and collecting membership fees. Netz.ac also provides an email system and digital door controls. In addition, it provides more specific infrastructure such as a payment and booking system for washing machines, vending machines, a cinema control system, and other projects that arise.

# History

The association was founded in 2007 as Netzwerkgruppe KaWo 1 e.V. and was only active in KaWo1. Ten years later, KaWo3 next door was completed and the association took over network operations for the time being. When it was decided that the network would be permanently run by the association, it was renamed Netzwerk KaWo.ac e.V. The next expansion came in 2023, when Netzwerk KaWo.ac e.V. and Netzwerkarbeitsgemeinschaft Kullenhof e.V. decided to merge. As a result, the association was renamed Netz.ac e.V. and the Kullenhof Networkgroup was merged into Netz.ac. The detailed history can be found on the website https://netz.ac/chronik (only available in German).

# Goals

The goal of Netz.ac is to create a standardized infrastructure in the dormitories in Aachen and to ensure every dorm has all the necessary technical support needed. This ensures a reliable service for residents and fun projects with limited ressources. Furthermore, the larger number of members promotes not only the exchange of knowledge but also project diversity and better training for new members.
