The Forschungsgemeinschaft elektronische Medien e.V. (FeM) is the
largest student society at the TU Ilmenau. It was founded in 1997 and
currently has about 2000 members.

Our mission is making new media tangible and available for students. The
societies philosophy means that everyone interested in new media will be
supported by the society and will get the chance to realise his ideas
and illusions. We have different teams where students of all professions
with similar interests meet, research together and broaden their
horizon. Many diverse projects exist, created by the initiative of
enquiring students. Every project comprises a team working individually
with electronic media. The possibilities are almost unlimited. FeM
offers you the possibility to explore the newest technologies. You can
realise your creative ideas or achieve your managerial skills for
leading postions. Everyone can find his self-fullfillment at FeM.

Our motto is: FeM connects. Young people come together to be active.

If you fancy to take part in our society you can look for a team or a
project to join in. New members wanting to help diversify the society
are always more than welcome.
