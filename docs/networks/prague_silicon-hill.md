## About Silicon Hill

Silicon Hill club is a part of the [Student Union of
CTU](https://su.cvut.cz/). As a dormitory club, it is based in the
largest CTU dormitory at
[Strahov](https://en.mapy.cz/zakladni?x=14.3904393&y=50.0798430&z=17&source=firm&id=2220580&q=koleje%20strahov),
Prague. As the biggest student club in Czechia we have around 4500
members.

### Network Infrastructure

#### History

The very first computer network was set up during 1993. There was only
one (Novell) server. Two years later first few networks were connected
to the Czech Technical University network. At the end of 1996 there were
300 computers (three times more than a year before) in five buildings.
Every floor had separate 10 Mbps coaxial cable segment connected to the
main building server. Those servers were connected by fibre to the
central CISCO router and from there by SkyWalker 2 x 4 Mbps microwave
link to the CVUT network.

During years 1996 and 1997 there were already 10 buildings connected,
the speed was increased and the whole student organization was being
formed. The first InstallFest conference was held during 1999. During
2001 we started another conference - OpenWeekend and developed our
information system - DUSPS - we used it for 10 years. Structured cabling
was also deployed in first two blocks.

The year 2006 was very dark as we started Microsoft conference and a own
restaurant so both of those intentions went very bad and didn't survive
for a long time. The only success was that we gained a hall - we call it
"the teaching center" since there are two halls as well as two
classrooms. We were testing some hardware for HP and got a powerful
cluster on which the Czech Academy of Sciences was working with us.

Around 2010 there was already AutoCAD academy, C academy, Matlab academy
and CISCO academy. The project weather.sh.cvut.cz was started - check it
out! :) In 2012 was in two months developed and started our current
information system - is.sh.cvut.cz - it is based on Ruby on Rails the
the main improvement was the speed. We tested HP and Juniper hardware
against current CISCO switches, then bought first CISCO Nexus box and
started the upgrade of our access switches from 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps. That
was also the first year of SUT - one IT-related talk every Tuesday
during the academic year.

A year after we renovated our main server room - new electricity
cabling, new AC units, second Nexus. The first year of "Summer with the
club" was held as the long-term activity for people working for the club
and enjoying several BBQs as the reward. We did complete IPv6 security
so we're sure which client has which address. We also tested several
WIFI vendors.

During 2014 the second server housing was started. First WIFI covered
block! We started to backup everything to CESNET - the connectivity is
good and they've tape storage. During 2015 we started ftp.sh.cvut.cz -
second iteration of our OSS mirror. Another three blocks covered by
WIFI. A year later we bought new UPS, 4k cameras, and our own Apiary,

#### Present

Today, the network follows the Core-Distribution-Access model with the
following topology. We have 2x 25 Gbps fiber connectivity form Czech
Technical University and 2x 500 Mbps backup from commercial provider. We're
connected to CESNET, the academical network in Czechia and from there to
GÈANT as well.

The core of our network was Cisco 6509E, in early 2020 it was replaced
with pair of Cisco Catalyst 9500-48Y4C in StackWise Virtual, the distribution was
made up by two Cisco Nexus 5596UP, in early 2025 we purchased pair of
Cisco Nexus 93360YC-FX2 and it is going to replace the older pair of N5596UP. We connect twelve dormitory buildings,
six floors each, every floor has two switches connected via fiber
with both Nexuses. Every tenant has 1 Gbps wired connection, its own
public IPv4 and IPv6 address. We managed to cover every building with
Aruba wireless solution - Wi-Fi 5 W1/W2. Later on several buildings have been upgraded
to Cisco Wi-Fi 6 solution and rests of dismantled Aruba solution was used
as an coverage upgrade for other buildings.

We've separate Admins and NetAdmins sections. Every block has its own
NetAdmin. There're also registrators to handle the load of people every
September. Every member and every device is stored in our information
system. From there our switches are configured and the configuration for
DNS, DHCP is stored in DB and synced with LDAP. If we receive an abuse we deal with it
properly so every member takes also the responsibility for himself.

![Network topology as of Sept.
2023](http://traffic.sh.cvut.cz/sit2023.png){.align-center}

In 2018, the main server room is planned to be relocated and renovated.
Virtualization Switched from Xen to OpenNebula, we also got our first
Blade chassis with several blade servers and three top-of-rack Juniper
switches.

### Projects

In addition to the network, we do some other activities including
operating gyms (one at every dormitory block + one main), AudioVisual
Center, Bastler's lab, academy (Autodesk, Linux and programming
courses). For those different purposes we maintain several "Projects".

-   Admins: Infrastructure administrators - Monitoring, backups,
-   Netadmins: Network administrators -
-   AVC: Audio-Visual Centrum - video & sound & lights ... conferences,
    concerts
-   MacGyver: Bastlers - IoT, 3D printing,
-   IS: Our information system - It handles users, network
    configuration, payments

## About Student union of CTU

The CTU Student Union consists of clubs based on dormitories and on
interests. It has its own structure and it also does its own activities
such as music festivals, student fairs and so on. Members from the
Student union are also representing us within the academic senate.

## About Strahov dormitory

We are located on the Petřín hill, pretty near to the Petřín tower.
There're several buses connecting us with two underground and several
tram lines as well as with the airport. We have twelve dormitory
buildings each six floor tall and we have one hall as well. There's
small market, plus minus six pubs, cafeteria and several sport fields.
The cable car is available within ten minutes but since it is very
touristy we recommend to walk down the hill and enjoy the beauty of
Kinský garden - it's still fifteen minutes but the park is actually very
big so you can definitely spend more time in there, especially as a
couple. On the other side of our area there's the biggest Czech
stadium - build during the communist times it's so big nobody knows how
to use it nowadays - it's less romantic but can be more adventurous
especially at night. Very nearby is also a park called Ladronka, it's
suitable for jogging and skating. Within the park there's also an old
homestead used as cultural center, gallery, roller skates rental,
restaurant, as well as fast-food joint.
