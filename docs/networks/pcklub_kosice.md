## About PCKlub

The first PCKlub was founded in the year 1997 at dormitory Jedlíkova 9, where a network consisting of network hubs and makeshift wall outlets was first laid out by students. In the next five years, PCKlub gradually expanded its network, and multiple other branches at different dormitories of the Technical University of Košice (abbr. TUKE) were founded.

As of today, each dormitory has its own PCKlub student club, which operates under the Student Council Civic Organization. Currently, there are 8 branches of PCKlub operational, 2 of which are located in the neighboring city of Prešov. The largest and most active clubs are located at dormitories Jedlíkova 9 and Jedlíkova 13, which house Slovak and foreign students of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering. Network connectivity is provided by the [Institute of Computer Technology at TUKE](https://uvt.tuke.sk/wps/portal), which is a member of the [Slovak Academic Network](https://www.sanet.sk/?page_id=2381) (abbr. SANET).
