## About PCKlub

First PCKlub was founded in year 1997 at dormitory Jedlíkova 9, where network consisting of network hubs and makeshift-made wall outlets was first laid out by students. In the next 5 years, PCKlub gradually expanded its network, and multiple other branches at different dormitories of Technical University of Košice (abbr. TUKE) were founded.

As of today, each dormitory has their own PCKlub student club, which operates under Student Council Civic Organisation. Currently, there are 8 branches of PCKlub operational, 2 of which are located at neighboring city of Prešov. The largest and most active clubs, are located at dormitories Jedlíkova 9 and Jedlíkova 13, which house Slovak and foreign students of Faculty of Electrical Engineering.
